# Analyzing tweets relating to coronavirus

My map is about the coronavirus tweets in the United States. There is a dense amount of points in California and Washington about Coronavirus. This makes sense since these states are densely populated with peopole.

 Also, the virus in the United States is said to have started in Washington, so it makes sense to see why there would be a densely amount of coronavirus related tweets from there.  California is very populated, so more people will talk about it.

It is pretty empty in the states east of Washington State of coronavirus related tweets. There is a lot of tweets about coronavirus tweets in th midwest, the south, and the east coast. This might be because there are few or little cases of coronavirus in those states, or the people who live there do not use Twitter often as other states, or there is just very little people living there.

New York City has the most cases, so it makes sense to see why New York and nearby states would be be tweeting a lot about the coronavirus since they would be affected by this. The south is protesting against the quaratine, as seen by
the latest tweets. They want to repopen, and I think that's why there is a lot of coronavirus related tweets.

>People are tweeting about repopening the state in the south and northern parts of Washington, according to the trending tweets I've seen on twitter these days. It makes sense why there are many coronavirus related tweets because of this.
